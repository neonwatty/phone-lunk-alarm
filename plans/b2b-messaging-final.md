# Phone Lunk Alarm - B2B Messaging (Final)

**Date:** 2025-11-05
**Status:** Approved - Ready for Implementation

---

## Strategic Positioning

**Target Audience:** Gym Owners / Gym Management (B2B SaaS)

**Reasoning:**
- B2B angle makes the gag funnier (gym owners thinking this is a real business solution)
- Better justifies "Join Waitlist" / "Request Demo" CTAs
- Creates more shareable/believable landing page screenshots for social media
- Gym owners have the actual business problem (member complaints, equipment hogging)
- Makes the waitlist reveal land harder ("you're an easy mark")

---

## Hero Section - Final Copy

### Headline
**Put Phone Lunks On Blast**

### Definition Box (Yellow Background, Purple Text)
**Phone Lunk (n.)** - Doom-scrolling equipment hog

### Subheadline
Phone lunks kill the vibe of your gym, piss off members, and slow throughput.
We catch them automatically and put them on blast with AI-powered justice.

### Call-to-Action Buttons
1. **Primary CTA:** "See It In Action" (links to #demo)
2. **Secondary CTA:** "How It Works" (links to #how-it-works)

---

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### What Makes This Work
- **Straight-faced absurdity** - Write like a real SaaS product, which makes it funnier
- **Real business problems** - "piss off members", "slow throughput", "kill the vibe"
- **Keeps the edge** - "idiot camper", "sitting on ass", "AI-powered justice"
- **Professional + provocative** - Balances B2B language with gym culture slang

### Key Phrases to Maintain
- "Phone Lunk" (brand terminology, inspired by Planet Fitness "lunk alarm")
- "Put them on blast" (public shaming, gym culture language)
- "Doom scrolling" (relatable internet behavior)
- "AI-powered justice" (tech credibility + humor)

### B2B Language to Include
- Throughput, retention, ROI, member satisfaction
- "Enterprise", "scalable", "zero confrontation required"
- Business metrics: "40% reduction", "NPS scores"

---

## Key Messaging Decisions

### Why "Put Phone Lunks On Blast" (Not Alternatives)
- Active, aggressive, speaks to gym owners
- "Put them on blast" = gym culture slang (authentic)
- Product benefit is in the headline (public shaming)
- Shorter than "Stop Phone Lunks From Killing Your Business"

### Why This Definition Works
- **"Idiot camper"** - Ties to gym terminology (equipment camping)
- **"Just to sit on ass"** - Emphasizes absurdity/annoyance
- **"Doom scroll on their phone"** - Makes behavior concrete and relatable
- **16 words** - Worth the length for clarity and impact

### Why This Subheadline Works
- **Three business problems** - Vibe, member satisfaction, throughput
- **"Piss off members"** - Key gym owner pain point (churn risk)
- **"We catch them automatically"** - Tech benefit (no staff needed)
- **"AI-powered justice"** - Humor + credibility

## Implementation Notes

### Visual Layout
```
[Hero Section - Center Aligned]

         PUT PHONE LUNKS ON BLAST

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Phone Lunk (n.) - Idiot camper who hogs        │
    │  equipment just to sit on ass and doom scroll   │
    │  on their phone                                  │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         (Yellow bg #F9F72E, Purple text #A4278D)

    They kill the vibe of your gym, piss off members,
    and slow throughput. We catch them automatically
    and put them on blast. AI-powered justice.

         [See It In Action]  [How It Works]
```

### Typography Suggestions
- **Headline:** Large, bold, all caps or title case
- **Definition box:** Slightly smaller, italic on "(n.)" only
- **Subheadline:** Medium size, regular weight, good line spacing

---

## Other Strategic Updates

### Navigation Changes
- **Remove:** "About", "Investors"
- **Add:** "How It Works", "Pricing" (Easter egg - goes to waitlist)
- **Rename:** "Try it Now" → "See Demo"

### Waitlist Page Reveal
**New copy:** "Wow, a gym owner who actually clicked 'Join Waitlist'! You're an easy mark!"

---

## Social Media Implications

### Better Hooks for Sharing
- "I built a B2B SaaS product that shames phone users at the gym"
- "Gym owners: this solves your #1 member complaint"
- "Planet Fitness lunk alarm but for equipment hogs"

### Screenshot Strategy
- Landing page looks like real B2B SaaS product
- Definition box is inherently shareable/memeable
- "Pricing" nav link adds to legitimacy
- Demo still works (credibility)

---

## Success Metrics

### How We'll Know This Works
1. More people click "Request Demo" / "Join Waitlist"
2. Longer time before users realize it's a gag
3. Better engagement on social media screenshots
4. "I actually thought this was real" reactions
5. Gym owner subreddits engage positively
